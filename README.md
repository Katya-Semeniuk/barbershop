# Barbershop is a site for men who are looking for the perfect hairstylist.

It showcases employees and their social networks so that site users can view portfolios of work and choose the one they like best. It is also very convenient that customers have access to information about prices and services, and they can immediately leave their data and wishes for a recording.

## Features

- Navigation Bar

The responsive navigation bar includes a link to the logo, which is also a link to the main page, as well as links to the About Us page, Services and Prices page, Barbers page and Contact page, and Online Booking. On the mobile version of the site, the site navigation is shown using a burger menu, which saves the header space quite well.

### Features Left to Implement

The burger menu will disappear automatically when you click on the corresponding section.

#### Validator Testing

The first problem I faced was the large size of the images, which is why they were uploaded with a delay. Using a resource like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) did not fix this situation. Therefore, I first cut the pictures to the maximum calculated size, and only then add them to the project. With these actions, it was possible to increase performance at lightouse

- HTML
  No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

##### Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
