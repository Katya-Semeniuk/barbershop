# Barbershop is a site for men who are looking for the perfect hairstylist.

It showcases employees and their social networks so that site users can view portfolios of work and choose the one they like best. It is also very convenient that customers have access to information about prices and services, and they can immediately leave their data and wishes for a recording.

## Features

Navigation Bar

The responsive navigation bar includes a link to the logo, which is also a link to the main page, as well as links to the About Us page, Services and Prices page, Barbers page and Contact page, and Online Booking. On the mobile version of the site, the site navigation is shown using a burger menu, which saves the header space quite well.

The landing page image

represents a photo with an image of a man's beard cut, as well as text over the image, drawing the attention of potential customers to the exquisite work of masters.

Best Barbershop in your city section

includes images of the work of the masters and introductory text, which allows users to understand the advantages of the Barbershop service and provides quick access to online registration.

Services and prices

this section helps users to immediately familiarize themselves with the type of services and prices, which saves time.

Our barbers section

includes getting to know the master by presenting his photo. And also includes links to his social networks, which will help customers learn more about the master himself and his works.

Contacts section consists of two parts.
The first is an online registration form. It is important that the user can enter his wishes and comments in the Message input field.
The second - contact data - location with a link to the map, quick dialing with one click on the line with the number. And also a link to write an email.
It is very convenient to provide information about the work schedule, which will help users better decide on the appropriate hour for recording.

The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites such as Instagram and Youtube. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

#### Validator Testing

HTML

The first problem I faced was the large size of the images, which is why they were uploaded with a delay. Using a resource like https://squoosh.app/ did not fix this situation. Therefore, I first cut the pictures to the maximum calculated size, and only then add them to the project. With these actions, it was possible to increase performance at lightouse

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
