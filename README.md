# Barbershop

is a site for men who are looking for the perfect hairstylist.

It showcases employees and their social networks so that site users can view portfolios of work and choose the one they like best. It is also very convenient that customers have access to information about prices and services, and they can immediately leave their data and wishes for a recording.

## Features

- ### Navigation Bar

The responsive navigation bar includes a link to the logo, which is also a link to the main page, as well as links to the About Us page, Services and Prices page, Barbers page and Contact page, and Online Booking. On the mobile version of the site, the site navigation is shown using a burger menu, which saves the header space quite well.

_The following tools helped to develop this project:_

## Fixed bugs

The first problem I faced was the large size of the images, which is why they were uploaded with a delay. Using a resource like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) did not fix this situation. Therefore, I first cut the pictures to the maximum calculated size, and only then add them to the project. With these actions, it was possible to increase performance at lightouse
